# KCenters.jl

The `KCenters` package implements algorithms that approximate the kcenters problem, in particular, we use farthest first traversal and density nets. It adds several variants of center selection and stopping criterions, along with a number of heuristics and utilities for taking advantage of the resulting groups.
